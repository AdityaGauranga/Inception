        <p>While it can be seen throughout our country that people appreciate your hand-made sketches or self-composed music, the one thing that lurks on their minds after that is, <i>how does he make a living out of this? </i>&nbspIt's easy to commend an artist's work, but what people really find hard to believe is the fact that are artists people who are well educated or do they think they can turn their passion into profession by choosing not to study, especially in India. While it's true, academics will lead you nowhere but what is being conveyed here is that academics <strong>is not</strong> your everyday Rice on your Lunch Thali or Chappatis on your main cuisine. India is well known for their valuable wisdom, culture and art, and yet here we are where the younger generation is encouraged more towards scientific and academic activities than creative fields. There are loads of talented folk out there who had to give up on their artistic traits and dreams just for the sake of getting a job in some well known company out of extreme peer pressure. </p>
        <p>I know people who say they want art as their profession but are simply thrashed down due to harsh criticisms and stereotypes around them. While most of them are still thriving and making their way to their dream passion, almost all of them had to pass certain barriers of stereotypes in the society. What do I mean by that? One can easily notice the change in the mood of the conversation as soon as the question, "How much do you earn out of all this?" is asked with a certain disinterest and disgust in the latter's face. In a country such as ours, where art and music can at best stay at the "hobby" level, is really no wonder why artists face such a predicament. Countless schools in India, including the one where I studied when I was a kid, had our "Art/Games" period taken out as a substitute to a Math or Science class. These may seem trivial but gradual curses to a tree will make it rot eventually.</p>
        <p>The origin and root of such behaviour towards the arts stems from the image of the profession itself. Believe it or not, even to this day, artists are perceived as being scruffy, dull, unorganized people with no real life dreams and ambitions. Artists are seen as products of lazy, dilapidated and disturbed childhood, who has nothing better to do so they take up art to satisfy their fantasies by drawing whatever they so desire. Another really unsetlling thing people believe is that these artists come from very affluent backgrounds. Why else would they choose to live a life that they know themselves is not promising in India to fill your stomach, as they wished without studying?</p>
        <p>According to several studies by researchers and scientists worldwide, people with an artistic bend have better visual and imagery abilities than normal people. </p>
