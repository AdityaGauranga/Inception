        <p>While it can be seen throughout our country that people appreciate your hand-made sketches or self-composed music, the one thing that lurks on their minds after that is, <i>how does he make a living out of this? </i>&nbspIt's easy to commend an artist's work, but what people really find hard to believe is the fact that are artists people who are well educated or do they think they can turn their passion into profession by choosing not to study, especially in India. While it's true, academics will lead you nowhere but what is being conveyed here is that academics <strong>is not</strong> your everyday Rice on your Lunch Thali or Chappatis on your main cuisine. India is well known for their valuable wisdom, culture and art, and yet here we are where the younger generation is encouraged more towards scientific and academic activities than creative fields. </p>
