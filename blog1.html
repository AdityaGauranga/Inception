            <p>While we all sit down, put up headphones, hold on to the gamepad and immerse in the game we play for hours, that's really what is seen by the normal public. Now by normal there may be different contexts, but for the people whose interests lie solely on gaming itself and be "self-claimed" critiques, there's not much fun in the performance. The fact stays true that debuggers and customers should not be undervalued just because they simply play and provide feedback about how the game's mechanics are. It is a necessity in the hierarchy itself. Not everyone can thrive or afford to learn massive lines of codes and later, write them! But the point is, there is more to it than the eye sees.</p>
            <p>Behind a massive open world world, lies an entire team of close to 50 people while an indie game can have less than 2 members. Heck it can be even one person if there's a need or desire of a particular individual. Of course the phrase, "Participating in the drama is lot more fun than just watching the drama", has been heard countless times now and its practically common  knowledge to anybody. But saying this to a gamer indicating that you should make a game instead of simply playing it all day, like a spoiled kid's parents shouting at him all day, would be a huge push.</p>
