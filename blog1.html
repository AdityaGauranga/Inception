            <p>While we all sit down, put up headphones, hold on to our gamepad and immerse in the game we play for hours, that's really what is seen by the normal public. Now by the word "normal" there may be different contexts, but for the people whose interests lie solely on gaming itself and be "self-claimed" critiques, there's not much fun in the performance. The fact stays true that debuggers and customers should not be undervalued just because they simply play and provide feedback about how the game's mechanics are. It is a necessity in the hierarchy itself. Not everyone can thrive or afford to learn massive lines of codes and later, write them! But the point is, there is more to it than the eye sees.</p>
            <p>Behind a massive open world world, lies an entire team of close to 50 people while an indie game can have less than five members. Heck it can be even one person if there's a need or desire of a particular individual. Of course the phrase, "Participating in the drama is lot more fun than just watching it", has been heard countless times now and its practically common knowledge. Why or how do you think games work? It's certainly not magic that you press the space key and a character starts jumping in the game and you keep holding down your "W" key to keep walking ahead. For game developers to release a game <i>they made</i> and people showering them with positive reviews and feedback, is like their satisfaction has reached a good ending. Just like a cook or a chef feels when they've fed others with their professionally cooked food and getting praises. The perspectives and levels of satisfaction is something one can decide for themselves but the point here is, there is always, <i>always</i> something going on behind the scenes. There are several teams handling each different aspect of the game, like the Designer, the Writer, the Programmer, the Artist, Level Designer and Composer and there may be more, who knows!?</p>
            <p>As an artist, completing <strong>one big sketch</strong> gave me immense satisfaction and I always had it added to my portfolio, gallery, wherever it was. Now if you think and imagine your piece of art to be put somewhere where it becomes lively and interactive, wouldn't it be beyond amazing? The artists in game development are putting their hand drawn art inside the games they make! They draw a beautiful landscape and make it as a background landscape for a certain level in the game, whilst adding hand drawn characters as someone to be standing or walking there in the landscape art. And if you are in love with the musics and melodies of a specific game, you can pass the credits and praises to the Composer team, who stays in charge of sound & music designing and editing </p>
