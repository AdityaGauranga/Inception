HTML & CSS notes

1. Semantic and non-semantic tags 
    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its     content.

2. <small></small>   Smaller text than paragraph text

3. Accessibility tree

4. Container tags

5. Inline list is like adding items in 1 row itself but that can't be done using only HTML    so CSS will be used in this regard.

6. The <nav> element: When screen reader is screen reading it,  these links are important to    traverse inside the website.

7. <!--CSS Way 1: Style tag
        
    <style>
        body {
            color: red;
        }
    </style> -->

   <!-- CSS Way 2: Style Attribute style="color: red"  -->

   <!-- CSS Way 3: Importing a separate css stylesheet -->
