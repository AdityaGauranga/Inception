HTML & CSS notes

1. Semantic and non-semantic tags 
    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its     content.

2. <small></small>   Smaller text than paragraph text

3. Accessibility tree

4. Container tags

5. Inline list is like adding items in 1 row itself but that can't be done using only HTML    so CSS will be used in this regard.

6. The <nav> element: When screen reader is screen reading it,  these links are important to    traverse inside the website.

7. <!--CSS Way 1: Style tag
        
    <style>
        body {
            color: red;
        }
    </style> -->

   <!-- CSS Way 2: Style Attribute style="color: red"  -->

   <!-- CSS Way 3: Importing a separate css stylesheet -->

8. CSS unit: "rem"
	      Everything is related to font size, normal font size is 16px. So upon zooming 	      in out in browser, "rem" keeps the font relative sized.

9. <span> tag 
	used to color a part of the text or change font type to bold or italics...									
10. <script> tag used for writing js in html file

11. Talking to browsers
	document.querySelector

12. working of querySelector internally
	As the name implies, query selector, it first selects the query and then basically 	sends it to the document i.e browser

13. Meaning of an API
	Application Programming Interface: Talking to an application via programming.
	Example: (a) document.querySelector is an API used to talk to document of the browser
		 (b) addEventListener is an API used to add an event to an HTML element

14. placeholder attribute will display light text inside a <textarea> tag for users to understand what to write inside it.

15. To test if the input in console.log is being read or not in the browser, inspect console and store the desired input element as a global variable and type
	temp1.value
and it will show whatever you typed. Its like a verification.
